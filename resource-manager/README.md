# `github.com/hashicorp/go-azure-sdk/resource-manager`

This SDK is an opinionated Go SDK for Azure Resource Manager, primarily intended to be used in the [Terraform AzureRM Provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm) and the [Packer Azure Plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-azure).

At this time this SDK uses both [the base-layer within this repository](../sdk) and [the `Azure/go-autorest` base layer](https://github.com/Azure/go-autorest) (although this older base layer is gradually being removed).

More information on this SDK, and how to use it, can be found in [the main `README.md` file](../README.md).
